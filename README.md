# SmartDrive
A simple PHP app that allows sharing of class resources by an individual running the server, assumably a lecturer

The lecturer or hoster is responsible for manually updating the contents of the root folder which by default is set to the **storage** folder

Project has been co-developed with **Johns Kumchenga** and **Yusuf Chimole** and 
was initially proposed by our lecturer  **Dr A Taylor**
